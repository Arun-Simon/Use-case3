Intelligent Log Anomalizer

Problem Statement: Production logs do not always contain explicit "ERROR" keywords

Objective: Build a tool that:
		Analyzes word frequency in logs
		Identifies rare or unusual patterns
		Flags potential anomalies
		Produces anomaly insights summary

Solution: 

Converted every word to lowercase and extracted the words, and marked the count
Counts all frequency
Words appearing less than or equal to 2 were marked as rare words
If a rare word is found, the line is marked as potential anomaly
